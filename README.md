# 🏗️ Personal System Structuring Tool (PSST)

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Personal System Structuring Tool** is a visual personal system management tool built with React, TypeScript, and ReactFlow. It employs a three-layer load-bearing structure design philosophy to help users transform abstract personal development goals into visual, actionable system diagrams.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Three-Layer Load-Bearing Structure
The system adopts architectural "load-bearing structure" concepts, dividing personal systems into three hierarchical layers:

1. **Core Purpose Layer** (Life Vision Layer) - Top-level load-bearing
2. **Primary Goals Layer** (Implementation Path Layer) - Middle-level load-bearing
3. **Foundation Support Layer** (Daily Practice Layer) - Base-level load-bearing

Each layer supports the weight of the layers above while providing structural stability, forming a complete and resilient personal development system.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🏗️ Three-Layer Visualization Architecture
- **Intelligent Height Allocation**: Automatic 1:2:3 proportional height distribution
- **Gradient Background**: Blue gradient from light to dark with clear visual hierarchy
- **Node Layer Constraints**: Smart containment of nodes within designated layers

### 🖱️ Advanced Interaction Features
- **Smart Boundary Detection**: Automatic layer boundary calculation during node dragging
- **Cross-Layer Connection Support**: Logical connections between different hierarchical layers
- **Viewport Locking**: Fixed viewport range for focused content area
- **Responsive Zooming**: Wheel-based zooming while maintaining structural integrity

### 📊 History & Insights
- **System Snapshots**: Save system states across different time periods
- **Change Tracking**: Record node adjustments and connection changes
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Identify persistent nodes and pattern changes
- **Timeline Navigation**: View system evolution along a chronological axis

### 🎨 Aesthetic Visual Design
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive interface design
- **Custom Nodes**: Carefully designed node visuals
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid interaction transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Perfect adaptation across various screen sizes

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Tech Stack
- **React 18** - Modern React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript superset
- **ReactFlow** - Professional flowchart visualization library
- **CSS Modules** - Modular style management
- **ResizeObserver API** - Responsive dimension monitoring

### Architectural Highlights
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Clear data management
- **Component-Based Design**: Highly reusable components
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent rendering and state management

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm 7+ or yarn 1.22+

### Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd psst

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build production version
npm run build
```

Access the application at http://localhost:3000.

## 🎮 User Guide

### Basic Operations
1. **Drag Nodes**: Freely drag nodes within their designated layers
2. **Create Connections**: Drag from one node to another to create connections
3. **Adjust View**: Use mouse wheel to zoom, right-click and drag to pan
4. **Save Snapshots**: Click "Seal Structure" to save current state

### Three-Layer Structure Operations
- **Core Purpose Layer**: Place long-term visions and core values
- **Primary Goals Layer**: Set medium-term objectives and key results
- **Foundation Support Layer**: Plan daily practices and habit formation

### Node Management
- Each node represents a system element (goals, habits, projects, etc.)
- Nodes can move freely within their designated layers but cannot cross layers
- Supports logical connections between nodes to form system networks

## 🎯 Application Scenarios
